Sports Data Valley (SDV) is a Dutch data and research platform that enhances sports performance, health, and well-being through data analysis. The initiative, supported by organizations such as TNO and NOC*NSF, brings together elite sports, science, and recreational sports to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

The platform collects, manages, and analyzes sports and health data in a secure and ethical manner. Athletes, coaches, and researchers can access advanced analytical tools and machine learning techniques to optimize training programs, prevent injuries, and improve recovery strategies.

Beyond elite sports, SDV contributes to scientific research and public health by collaborating with healthcare institutions and businesses. As a result, it supports not only athletes but also the general population in promoting an active lifestyle.

The Stress in Action consortium aims to utilize SDV for scientific research on stress and health. By leveraging SDV’s infrastructure, researchers can track participants longitudinally and collect real-time data on their daily activities, physiological responses, and well-being. This enables the identification of stress patterns and analysis of how lifestyle, physical activity, and environmental factors contribute to stress regulation.
